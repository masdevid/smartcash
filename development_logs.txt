====================
REMAINING ISSUES:

- ✅ VERIFIED: All log_info(), log_debug(), log_error() calls now work correctly
- ✅ VERIFIED: All 5 button handlers properly registered and working
- ✅ VERIFIED: 24 UI components available with operation container logging

- ✅ FIXED: Removed ModelConfigSyncMixin from COLAB operations (use direct file sync instead)
- ✅ FIXED: All sync_configuration_with_modules method calls replaced with direct logging
- ✅ FIXED: Folder creation no longer creates /content/SmartCash code copy - only required folders

- ✅ FIXED: All 5 COLAB setup stages complete successfully in local environment
- ✅ FIXED: Progress tracker turns RED on errors with proper visual feedback
- ✅ FIXED: Comprehensive error handling and diagnostics for actual Colab environments

  - "✅ Pretrain YOLOv5 downloaded 23.4MB in 0.5s"
  - "✅ Pretrain EfficientNet-B4 downloaded 23.4MB in 0.5s"
  - "✅ Pretrained model exists on local, skipping download (YOLOv5s 23.4MB)"
- ✅ FIXED: Validation operation shows location context and detailed results:
  - "✅ Pretrained model exist on drive and validation passed (YOLOv5s 23.4MB)"
  - "❌ Pretrained model validation failed on local (EfficientNet-B4: size mismatch)"
- ✅ FIXED: Cleanup operation shows specific models being removed:
  - "🗑️ Pretrained model YOLOv5s removed (23.4MB)"
  - "✅ Cleanup complete: removed 2 invalid models, freed 46.8MB"
  - "🗑️ Removed models: YOLOv5s (23.4MB), EfficientNet-B4 (23.4MB)"

- ✅ FIXED: Fixed button widget key name mismatch in handler registration
- ✅ FIXED: Enhanced button lookup with multiple access methods (direct, widget, action_container)
- ✅ FIXED: Added buttons to widgets dict for consistent access patterns
- ✅ FIXED: All 5 buttons now working: validate, build, rescan_models, save, reset
- 🔧 ROOT CAUSE: Button stored as 'rescan_models' but handler looked for 'rescan_models_button'
- ✅ VERIFIED: Button creation, extraction, handler registration all working correctly

✅ TRAINING MODULE (FIXED):
- ✅ FIXED: Changed 'refresh_backbone_config' button style from 'secondary' to 'info' (invalid style error)  
- ✅ FIXED: Added button extraction code to store all action buttons in UI components
- ✅ FIXED: All 6 buttons now working: start_training, stop_training, resume_training, refresh_backbone_config, save, reset
- ✅ FIXED: Training start failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'copy' - fixed in BaseUIModule.get_current_config()
- ✅ FIXED: get_current_config() now returns default config instead of None when config handler unavailable
- ⚠️ REMAINING: Training fails with prerequisite check (expected behavior when no backbone models available)


✅ EVALUATION MODULE (FULLY FIXED - 2025-07-21):
- ✅ FIXED: Changed button ID from 'run_scenario' to 'run_evaluation' to match handler
- ✅ FIXED: Added 'refresh_models' button to action container

- ✅ FIXED: Checkpoint discovery now limited to 5 latest (sorted by modification time)
- ✅ FIXED: UI container styling with overflow handling to prevent horizontal scrollbars
- ✅ FIXED: Prerequisite error logging: "❌ Evaluation failed to start: prerequisite not met - no valid checkpoints available"
- ✅ FIXED: Discovery logs now appear in operation container instead of outside:
  - OLD: [2025-07-21 10:05:01] INFO - EvaluationUIModule.discovery - 📋 Discovered 0 valid checkpoints
  - NEW: Logs properly routed to operation container via _log_discovery() method
- 🔧 Enhanced files: model_discovery_mixin.py, evaluation_uimodule.py, evaluation_ui.py
- 🔧 ROOT CAUSE: ModelDiscoveryMixin used separate logger instead of parent module logging system

✅ ALL MODULES ENVIRONMENT INDICATORS (FULLY FIXED - 2025-07-21):
- ✅ FIXED: Environment indicators now correctly show 'colab' when running in Colab environments
- ✅ FIXED: Enhanced _detect_environment() to use comprehensive detection from smartcash.common.environment
- ✅ FIXED: Improved environment detection timing (after mixin setup and during initialization)
- ✅ FIXED: Added refresh_environment_detection() for dynamic environment updates
- ✅ FIXED: Header containers now update with correct environment information
- ✅ APPLIES TO: All 10 UI modules (preprocessing, visualization, pretrained, backbone, training, evaluation, etc.)
- 🔧 ROOT CAUSE: BaseUIModule used simple detection vs comprehensive detection in common.environment
- 🔧 Enhanced file: base_ui_module.py with consistent environment detection across all modules
