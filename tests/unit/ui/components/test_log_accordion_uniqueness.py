"""Tests ensuring that only a single LogAccordion instance is created per footer container.

The FooterContainer now uses the modern LogAccordion implementation directly instead of
the legacy procedural `create_log_accordion` helper. This test verifies that repeated
creation of footer containers with the same parameters creates separate LogAccordion
instances as expected, avoiding any shared state issues.
