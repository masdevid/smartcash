🔍 Why CSPDarknet Falls Back to Custom Implementation:

  1. The Real Issue:

  Looking at the code in backbone_factory.py:113, there's an intentional exception being thrown:

  # YOLOv5 has complex layer connections, so we can't just extract backbone as Sequential
  # Instead, we'll use the custom implementation as it's more reliable
  raise Exception("YOLOv5 architecture too complex for simple Sequential extraction")

  2. Technical Reasons:

  YOLOv5 Architecture Complexity:
  - Non-Sequential Structure: YOLOv5 uses a complex graph-based architecture with skip connections, feature
  pyramid networks (FPN), and path aggregation networks (PAN)
  - Branching Connections: Unlike simple backbones, YOLOv5 has multiple parallel paths and cross-layer
  connections
  - AutoShape Wrapper: The torch.hub YOLOv5 comes wrapped in AutoShape, making backbone extraction difficult
  - Feature Extraction Points: YOLOv5 needs specific intermediate feature maps (P3, P4, P5) that aren't easily
  extractable from the hub model

  What Makes it "Too Complex":
  YOLOv5 Full Model:
  ├── Backbone (CSPDarknet) ─┐
  ├── Neck (FPN + PAN)      ─┼─ Complex interconnections
  ├── Head (Detection)      ─┘
  └── AutoShape wrapper

  Simple Sequential Model:
  Layer1 → Layer2 → Layer3 → Output (too simple for YOLOv5)

  3. Why Custom Implementation is Better:

  Advantages of Custom CSPDarknet:
  - Clean Feature Extraction: Built specifically for multi-layer detection with clear P3, P4, P5 outputs
  - No AutoShape Overhead: Direct backbone without unnecessary wrappers
  - Predictable Architecture: Sequential layers with known channel counts
  - Multi-Layer Support: Designed for SmartCash's 3-layer detection system
  - Better Control: Can modify architecture for specific needs

  Custom Implementation Benefits:
  self.backbone = nn.Sequential(
      self._conv_block(3, 32, 6, 2, 2),     # 0: 32 channels
      self._conv_block(32, 64, 3, 2, 1),    # 1: 64 channels
      self._csp_stage(64, 128, 3),          # 2: 128 channels -> P3
      self._csp_stage(128, 256, 3),         # 4: 256 channels -> P4
      self._csp_stage(256, 512, 3),         # 6: 512 channels -> P5
      # Clean, predictable feature extraction points
  )

  4. The Design Decision:

  The developers intentionally chose to use a custom implementation because:
  - Reliability: Custom implementation is more predictable
  - Performance: No overhead from YOLOv5's full detection pipeline
  - Compatibility: Works better with SmartCash's multi-layer detection
  - Maintainability: Easier to debug and modify
