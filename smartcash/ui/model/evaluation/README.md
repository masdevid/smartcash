✅ Evaluation Module Refactoring - CORRECTED

1. Corrected Model Selection Logic
    - 1st row form: Real model selection (backbone +
  layer mode selection)
    - 2nd row display: Display-only list showing
  available best models
    - Models follow {scenario}_{backbone}_{layer}
  naming format
    - Properly integrated with backbone → training →
  evaluation workflow
2. Updated Layout Structure
Row 1: [Execution Options]     | [Model Selection
(backbone + layer)]
Row 2: [Metrics Selection]     | [Available Models
Display + Refresh]
3. Proper Model Naming Convention
    - `position_yolov5_efficientnet-b4_single_layer`
    - `lighting_yolov5_cspdarknet_multi_layer`
    - Follows the exact `{scenario}_{backbone}_{layer}`
  format
4. Workflow Integration
    - Backbone module → builds yolov5_efficientnet-b4
  and yolov5_cspdarknet models
    - Training module → trains using built models
    - Evaluation module → uses best models from
  training process
    - Prerequisite checks ensure models are available

Key Features:

- Form-based model selection: Backbone and layer mode selections in 1st row determine which models to evaluate
- Display-only model list: 2nd row shows available models with refresh functionality (display only)
- Automatic model discovery: Uses {scenario}_{backbone}_{layer} format to find trained models
- BaseUIModule pattern: Full refactoring with operation handlers, prerequisite checks, progress tracking
- Clean architecture: Removed display logic from components, proper separation of concerns

The evaluation module now correctly follows the workflow: user selects backbone and layer mode → system automatically finds corresponding trained models using the naming convention → evaluates those models across scenarios. models using the naming convention → evaluates those
models across scenarios.
