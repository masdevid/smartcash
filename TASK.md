# GENERAL
- [ ] Create Consistent Summary Format for Downloader, Preprocessing and Augmentation UI Module

# COLAB MODULE
- ✅ All Works

# DEPENDENCY MODULE
- [✅] Progress tracker not appearing - Fixed with proper timing delays
- [✅] Install, Uninstall and updates process use synchronous - Already implemented correctly
- [✅] Check missing packages and updates should use threadpool for faster response - Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor for check operations
- [✅] Ensure no overlapping operations - Added operation lock mechanism with proper validation
- [✅] Button states should be disabled during operations - Fixed BaseUIModule to disable all buttons during operations and re-enable after completion
- [✅] Config manager logs leaking outside operation container - Fixed by suppressing config manager console logs in base operation
- [✅] Installation should only install missing packages instead of all packages - Added package checking to only install packages that are not already installed 

# DOWNLOAD MODULE
- [✅] Each operation done should update summary result - Implemented summary container integration with formatted markdown output for all operations (download, check, cleanup) 
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html
- [ ] Need confirmation dialog working on download/cleanup dataset operations on existing data in `/data/{train, valid, test}`

# PREPROCESSING MODULE
- [✅] Create quick backend service readiness check. Add new api on `smartcash/dataset/preprocessor/api` that do quick check (empty or not) on `/dataset/preprocessed/{train, valid, test}/{labels, images}` - Implemented readiness_api.py with comprehensive checks
- [✅] Add post init hook using quick check api and set service ready flag in preprocessing ui module - Added _post_init_tasks method with service readiness detection
- [✅] Do not run download and cleanup operation if service not ready - Updated validation methods to check service readiness
- [✅] If service ready, open confirmation dialog if existing data found - Enhanced confirmation dialogs with existing data warnings
- [✅] Operation summary missing new line formatting - Fixed with core HTML formatter utility 
- [ ] `Service belum siap - tidak dapat melakukan cleanup. Pastikan direktori data telah dibuat dengan benar.` -> false negative. I'm running in colab and data in `/data/{train, valid, test}` is exist.
- [ ] Audit quick check update api:
    - Preprocessing should check `/data/{train, valid, test}/{labels, images}`
    - Cleanup should check `/data/preprocessed/{train, valid, test}/{labels, images}`
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html

# SPLIT MODULE
- ✅ All Works

# AUGMENTATION MODULE
- [✅] Summary Container on UI dictionary but not yet updated when operations done. Should be like preprocessing operation summary - Updated to use core HTML formatter utility 
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html

# PRETRAINED MODULE
- ✅ All Works

# BACKBONE MODULE
- [✅] Ensure each operation clear operation log first before logging new operation log - Added clear_operation_logs() method to base operation class
- [✅] Ensure Dynamic Button Registration only run once on init and not poluting log during operations - Added _buttons_registered flag to prevent duplicate registration 
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html from backend
- [✅] Rescan build models seems has looping bug. Optimize it to discover in paralel using threadpool - Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor with concurrent.futures for parallel model discovery with proper timeouts and error handling
- [✅] It discover zero model while model exist on `/data/models/backbone_smartcash_efficientnet_b4_20250723_1209.pt (122.0MB)` - Enhanced metadata extraction to properly handle both EfficientNet and CSPDarkNet naming patterns
- [✅] Progress tracker stucks on 25% while the whole operations successfull - Fixed dual progress calculation to properly combine completed steps with current step progress
- [✅] Bug: ⚠️ No clear method available on operation container - Added robust clear method handling with multiple fallback approaches (clear_logs, clear_operations, clear, reset, clear_output)
- [ ] Ensure use proper inheritance with base_ui_module and existing mixin
- [ ] Do comprehensive operations tests with more edge cases

# TRAINING MODULE
- [✅] Ensure each operation clear operation log first before logging new operation log - Added clear_operation_logs() method to training base operation class
- [✅] Ensure Dynamic Button Registration only run once on init and not poluting log during operations - Added _buttons_registered flag with duplicate prevention 
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html from backend
- [ ] Triple progress tracker well integrated with backend progress callback
- [✅] Why get build model error when it supposed to be not rebuild the model that done before in bacbone module? - Fixed by implementing proper backbone model discovery with existence verification and manual fallback discovery when backbone module unavailable
    - ✅ Enhanced _get_backbone_configuration() to check for built models
    - ✅ Added _discover_backbone_models_manually() for fallback model discovery
    - ✅ Updated _select_model_from_backbone() to validate model availability before proceeding
- [✅] Prerequisete check seem has performance issue (too slow for checking thins). Optimize it - Replaced synchronous package checking with parallel ThreadPoolExecutor-based checking for significant performance improvement



# EVALUATION MODULE
- [✅] Ensure each operation clear operation log first before logging new operation log - Added clear_operation_logs() method to evaluation base operation class and all concrete operations
- [✅] Ensure Dynamic Button Registration only run once on init and not poluting log during operations - Added _buttons_registered flag with duplicate prevention
- [✅] Remove this handler to not triggering unnecesary log from dynamic buttons registration - Commented out missing button handlers for 'stop_evaluation' and 'export_results'
- [ ] I've installed markdown package, so use it to generate summary html from backend

# VISUALIZATION MODULE
- [✅] Dashboard cards still not appearing. Only blank container - Fixed container layout issues, improved placeholder data initialization, and simplified dashboard card creation process
